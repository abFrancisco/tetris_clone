	Start with a puzzle game like Tetris. In fact, start with Tetris, 
	then...

	Make a game like Tetris -- by that I mean simple graphics, 
	simple rules, simple win and lose states, scoring, and so on. 
	Try to be creative and make something somewhat unique here.

	At this point you've made two simple 2D games. 
	Here is where my advice on this has changed in the last couple years.
	For your next game, I recommend a physics puzzler.
	This lets you build on what you learned with the first two,
	while introducing you to physics, the idea of using a strange library
	(box2d is a great one to play with) and the complexity of making your
	simple rules work with two systems not designed to work together
	(your graphics engine and your physics engine).

	Next, platformer

	Next, puzzle platformer or platformer with RPG elements

	Finally, one of the above games (your choice) in 3D.
